I am currently developing a compiler named AtomC_Compiler for my Formal Languages & Compilation Techniques course.

Components:
* **Lexical Analyzer**: The lexical analyzer, also known as a lexer, processes the input source code to divide it into sequences called tokens.
These tokens include keywords, identifiers, numbers, and operator characters.
* **Syntax Analyzer**: The syntax analyzer, or parser, takes the tokens generated by the lexical analyzer and, based on the syntactic grammar, groups these lexical atoms into language-specific sequences: expressions, declarations, instructions
* **Semantic Analyzer**: It deals with the meaning of the program. Syntax establishes the form of the program, while semantics determine its content.
There can be multiple forms that have the same content (e.g., nearly every programming language has a while statement, but with different syntax).
Semantic analysis includes:
  -   **Domain Analyzer** – this part evaluates the program’s declarations, such as variables and functions.
  -   **Type Analyzer** – this part evaluates how constants and symbols are utilized in the program.

* **Virtual Machine**: This is not a part of the compiler itself but is an environment where the compiled code can be executed.
It acts as an intermediary layer between the compiled code and the physical hardware, enabling the compiled code to run on multiple platforms without modification.
